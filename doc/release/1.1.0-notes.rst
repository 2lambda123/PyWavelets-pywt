PyWavelets 1.1.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.1.

This release requires Python >=3.5 and has dropped Python 2.7 support.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

When using complex-valued wavelets with the ``cwt``, the output will now be
the complex conjugate of the result that was produced by PyWavelets 1.0.x.
This was done to account for a bug described below. The magnitude of the
``cwt`` coefficients will still match those from previous releases.

Bugs Fixed
==========

For a ``cwt`` with complex wavelets, the results in PyWavelets 1.0.x releases
matched the output of Matlab R2012a's ``cwt``. Howveer, older Matlab releases
like R2012a had a phase that was of opposite sign to that given in textbook
definitions of the CWT (Eq. 2 of Torrence and Compo's review article, "A
Practical Guide to Wavelet Analysis"). Consequently, the wavelet coefficients
were the complex conjugates of the expected result. This was validated by
comparing the results of a transform using ``cmor1.0-1.0`` as compared to the
``cwt`` implementation available in Matlab R2017b as well as the function
``wt.m`` from the Lancaster University Physics department's
`MODA toolbox <https://github.com/luphysics/MODA>`_
