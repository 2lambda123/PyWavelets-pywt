Bugs Fixed
==========
For the complex wavelet transforms, the tests were based on older implementation of Matlab CWT function that had an issue with the phase of the complex wavelet coefficients.
Consequently, the complex wavelet coefficients were complex conjugates of the proper result.
The tests were made using cmor1.0-1.0 and compared to the WT implementation proposed by Matlab R2017b and Lancaster University, Physics department Matlab function ``wt.m``.
