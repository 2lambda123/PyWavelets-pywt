PyWavelets 1.5.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.5.

PyWavelets now uses Meson as its build system, and meson-python
as the build backend. This requires no changes from users, a
``pip install pywavelets`` will now use ``meson-python`` under
the hood.
